												<p>
												    Delivering multiple roles effortlessly every single day, women are undoubtedly the backbone of any society. Doting daughters, caring mothers, competent colleagues and a wide range of many other roles are played by women around us flawlessly and with grace.</p>
                                                    <p>
												    However, they’ve also been an ignored fraction of the society in many parts of the world. This, in turn, has caused women at large to bear the brunt of inequality, oppression, financial dependability and other social evils. For centuries now, women have been living under bondage that restricts them from achieving professional as well as personal heights.</p>
<p>
												    Empowering Women Socially and Economically
												    To restore their rightful and dignified status, justice For Children And Women Society has initiated women empowerment programs that provide a solid foundation to nurture the inner strength, creativity and self-esteem of women from all walks of life. With this base well established, women are now able to go out into the world, prepared to handle any challenge with skills, confidence and grace. They come to the forefront, where they become agents of peace and positive social change for themselves, their families, other women and their society.</p>
<p>
												    5 Women Empowerment programs taken up by The Indian Women and Child Welfare Trust:<br>
												    – Economic independence<br>

												    – Girl child education<br>

												    –Health<br>

												    – Leadership<br>
